üõ†Ô∏è Environment Builder with LLM + Modal
This is an agentic system that automatically creates 100% compatible development environments based on a user request and gives back bash commands for local replication.

‚úÖ Powered by LLM + Modal for iterative reasoning and real-time validation.

üîç How It Works
The tool uses a three-stage architecture to ensure that the resulting environment is functional and conflict-free:

1. Command Generation
The LLM receives your request and generates:

Installation commands (bash)

Testing commands to validate the environment in the next step

2. Execution & Testing
These commands are executed in a fresh environment via Modal:

The environment is actually installed

All test commands are run to validate compatibility

3. Log Analysis & Repair
If any installation or test fails:

The logs are passed back to the LLM

It proposes fixes or additional commands

Stage 2 is re-run with the updated instructions

‚ú® What You Get
You simply enter a prompt like:

"I want an environment for ML development with CUDA 12.4"

And the system:

Guides you through basic choices (Conda? GPU? Python version?)

Automatically builds and tests the environment

Returns a ready-to-use, working set of installation commands

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes on Conda
Conda-based environments (especially with conda-forge) are supported.

But they are more resource-intensive and may take up to 20 minutes to build.

ü§ñ Why Use This?
Most current LLMs still struggle with:

Accurate dependency resolution

Version compatibility

Conda + GPU + CUDA constraints

This tool solves that by:

Using real-time validation via Modal

Iterating until the environment is correct

Saving you hours of debugging and documentation reading
